# AI Workflow Assignment: Predicting Dropouts & Hospital Readmission

This project explores the complete AI development workflow using two case studies:

1. **Online Student Dropout Prediction** – A system to identify and intervene with at-risk learners.
2. **Hospital Readmission Risk** – Predict if patients will be readmitted within 30 days of discharge.

## 📊 Key Metrics
- F1-Score (Student Dropout): ≥ 0.85
- Precision/Recall (Readmission): Optimized for minimizing false negatives

---

## 🔐 Ethical Considerations
- Ensures patient privacy via local data handling
- Reduces model bias using balanced datasets and fairness-aware evaluation
